This repository contains the source code used by the `Shadoks` team to win first place at the [CG:SHOP 2024 challenge](https://cgshop.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/competition/cg-shop-2024/#problem-description) about a knapsack polygonal packing problem. More information about the algorithms used is available at the following paper.

The code has been used only to obtain solutions to the challenge, and some bugs have been detected and not fixed. The main purpose of the code is a source of ideas, rather than a read-to-use solver.
